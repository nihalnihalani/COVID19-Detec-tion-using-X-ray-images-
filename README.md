# 🦠 COVID-19 Detection Using X-ray Images

This project focuses on detecting COVID-19 from X-ray images using deep learning techniques. By training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the system aims to classify whether a given chest X-ray image indicates the presence of COVID-19.

## 🧠 Approach

1. **Data Collection:** The X-ray images are collected from publicly available datasets.
2. **Preprocessing:** The images are resized and normalized before feeding them into the CNN model.
3. **Model:** A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to classify the X-ray images as either positive or negative for COVID-19.
4. **Evaluation:** The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** (Programming Language)
- **TensorFlow** / **Keras** (Deep Learning Framework)
- **OpenCV** (Image Processing)
- **Matplotlib** (Data Visualization)

## 📈 Results

The system shows promising results in accurately detecting COVID-19 from chest X-rays, with the potential to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis.
